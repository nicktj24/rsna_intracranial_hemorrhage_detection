Intracranial hemorrhage, bleeding that occurs inside the cranium, is a serious health problem requiring rapid and often intensive medical treatment.  Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the patientâ€™s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated and often time consuming. In this problem, I developed an algorithm to detect acute intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes using VGG16 model.
